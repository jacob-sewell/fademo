# Simple FormAssembly API demo

This very simple (and ugly!) script collects some data from FormAssembly via its API, does a little math on it, and generates a filled fillable pdf using the FPDM class found here (http://www.fpdf.org/en/script/script93.php).

If you wish to run this code, you'll need to download FPDM and put it in lib/fpdm.
